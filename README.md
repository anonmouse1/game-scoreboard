# GAA scoreboard

A very basic implementation of a GAA (Gaelic Athletics Association) scoreboard system that can be used to keep track of scores in gaelic sports such as hurling,football or camogie.

- 1 goal(under crossbar and between posts) = 3 points
- 1 point(over crossbar and between posts) = 1 point

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
